Introduction to MarkDown

## What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As the quote says, you simply write your notes with a specific set of symbols and you'll be able to easily convert it to HTML and make it look pretty.

This document is written entirely in markdown. All future presentations and lecture notes will be written in markdown as well.

## Quick HTML Entity Reference

Some symbols have different meanings in HTML, so to use these symbols you have to use the codes for them. I've listed a few common ones here.
