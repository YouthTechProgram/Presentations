We will be using Git and Github to house everything that's developed by Youth Tech participants. You will need to create an account on Github even if you're not interesting in coding, collaboration will be needed and more than just programmers can use Github.

1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for GitHub
    - Be sure to choose the free plan. If you would like have paid account, Github provides educational discounts for students with a .edu email, so if you have one, you may request your [educational discount](https://education.github.com/).
2. I will be adding one person from each team to your Github repository and then that one person will add the rest of the team members
3. Fill out [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile)

4. Change your team name and description.

Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed revision control system. In other words, because we will be working with code, we want to be able to keep a history of all our changes and know who to blame when part of the code is broken. By being able to keep track of working code, you can always go back to version that did work.

Git makes collaboration easy where you can share code or datasets with your team and they will always have the most up to date version of the file.

## Configure your account with the GitHub app

1. Download the [windows client](https://windows.github.com/) and the [git command line tool](https://msysgit.github.io/); we will be using both so download and install both.
2. Sign in with your Github account. Be sure to use "Github" and **not** "Github Enterprise"
3. Set up your identity. This information that will be used to identify you each time you contribute something to the respository. Be sure to use the same email address you used on Github so your contributions will automatically be attributed to you.

4. Clone your team's repository from the Github client.
