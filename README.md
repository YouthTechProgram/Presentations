### What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As the quote says, you simply write your notes with a specific set of symbols and you'll be able to easily convert it to HTML and make it look pretty.

This document is written in markdown.

Git

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed revision control system. In other words, because we will be working with code, we want to be able to keep a history of all our changes and know who to blame when part of the code is broken. Breaking code is no longer something to worry about and sharing code is easy.

### Installing Git

1. Visit the following website and download the install

   [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win)
   
2. Open the installer, accept the license, and install Git to the default location (`C:\Program Files\Git`).

3. Configure the installation
	
	- Additional Icons
	
		- Self explanitory. You add shortcuts to the desktop and the start menu
	
	- Windows Explorer Integration
	
		- Simple context menu
		
			- Will install a command-line tool and will add menu options relating to Git
			
		- Advanced context menu
		
			- Will do the same as the Simple context menu but it'll install another application to handle Git operations
			
	- Associate _blah blah blah_
	
		- Leave it checked, it'll make life easier later
		
	- Use a TrueType font
	
		- (optional) it'll give you a prettier font to look at

4. Start menu folder

	- Whatever tickles your fancy
	
5. Use Git from Git bash only

	- It'll make life much easier if you just use this
	
6. Checkout Windows-style commit Unix-style line endings

	- Windows uses CRLF while Unix (Mac and Linux) machines use LF for line endings. Doesn't really matter which you choose since most Git repositories will be configured to use a specific one.
	
7. Install
