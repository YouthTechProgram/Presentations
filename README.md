Youth Tech 2014
===============

In this repository you will be able to see all of the lesson plans for the upcoming weeks and what I plan on going over. If you feel comfortable enough with the current work, feel free to look ahead.

### Software

We will be using a variety of software throughout the program and each software has their own use/purpose so get ready to start installing a lot of things. We will install things as we need them so don't worry if you don't know why you need a specific program.

### Lesson Plans

All of the lesson plans are divided up into weeks, and each week is split up into days. We'll try our best to stay on schedule but I make no promises. Inside of each folder, you will find any example code and notes that I have for that lesson; please use them.
