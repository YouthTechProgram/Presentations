Introduction to Git
-------------------

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed revision control system. In other words, because we will be working with code, we want to be able to keep a history of all our changes and know who to blame when part of the code is broken. Breaking code is not something to worry about and sharing code is easy. Blah blah blah...

### Configure your account with the GitHub app

1. Sign in

2. Set up identity

    - The information that will be used to identify you each time you contribute something to the respository

3. Clone your repository

    - ...\Documents\Github\repository
    
4. Make a change

5. Sync it

6. Pull it

Introduction to MarkDown
------------------------

### What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As the quote says, you simply write your notes with a specific set of symbols and you'll be able to easily convert it to HTML and make it look pretty.

This document is written entirely in markdown.

### Quick HTML Entity Reference

Some symbols have different meanings in HTML, so to use these symbols you have to use the codes for them. I've listed a few common ones here.

    &  |  &amp;
    ©  |  &copy;
    ®  |  &reg;
    ¡  |  &iexcl;
    ¿  |  &iquest;

    ¼  |  &frac14;
    ½  |  &frac12; -or- &half;
    ¾  |  &frac34;

    <  |  &lt;
    >  |  &gt;

    «  |  &laquo;
    »  |  &raquo;

    ²  |  &sup2;
    ³  |  &sup3;
    °  |  &deg;
