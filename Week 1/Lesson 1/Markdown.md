### What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As the quote says, you simply write your notes with a specific set of symbols and you'll be able to easily convert it to HTML and make it look pretty.

This document is written entirely in markdown.
